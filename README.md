# Resume-parser
A resume parser is a tool that automatically extracts and organizes information from resumes. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize key details such as contact information, work experience, education, skills, and more. This helps streamline the recruitment process by allowing recruiters to quickly and efficiently review and compare candidate qualifications.

The resume parser typically works in the following steps:

Data Extraction: The parser scans the resume to extract relevant information.

Data Structuring: The extracted data is organized into predefined categories.

Data Storage: The structured data is stored in a database or applicant tracking system (ATS) for easy access and analysis.

Data Analysis: The parsed data can be analyzed to match candidates with job requirements, identify top candidates, and generate insights.
